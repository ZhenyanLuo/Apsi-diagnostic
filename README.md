Codes stored in this repo is used for `'desgin primers based on single copy orthologs'` and `'visualize result'` in the manuscript:
"Mating-compatibility genes employed as diagnostic markers to identify novel incursions of the myrtle rust pathogen Austropuccinia psidii"

The pipeline which used for designing primers based on single copy orthologs can be used in this order:

SOG_assign_gene.py -> SOG_primalscheme -> SOG_primer_verify -> SOG_report.py 

The final output is a table which consisted of detail summary of primer sequences and captibility of capturing variants.


If you find these scripts useful, please cite the above manuscript.
